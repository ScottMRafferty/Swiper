Swiper Metadata Filter for Domino Designer Source Control

## Description
Swiper is a plugin for Domino Designer which is used in tandem with the Source Control Enablement.
When Domino Design Elements are exported for Source Control, they contain unnecessary metadata which makes Branching and Merging almost impossible due to pointless merge conflicts.
Swiper will filter this metadata from the exported files, allowing proper branching and merging.

Swiper is the sucessor to the Dora project. The Dora project was specifically built for use with Git, whereas Swiper can be used for Git, Mercurial, .
Installation is also much simpler.

Swiper will be released for alpha testing very soon…
